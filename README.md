Industrial engineer with great sense of urgency and control, since 2012 when I get my job at Megasuper(Retail company in Costa Rica) started as process auditor that allow me to learn how to use in a professional way Excel which for me became an essential tool for the analysis to control the efficiency at all indicator you should handle, so the Inventory coordinator gave the responsibilities to be the process auditor in the reports, so my job was taking several data bases from SQL and matches between them with the information about inventory movement, usernames, logistic, dates, reception, sales, ect., this kind job introduce me too in the world of negotiation and reporting because I started to create a bridge between all of the parts involved so I send email and made phone call to the coordinador of logistic, sales, operation, supermarket, and also with all the 70 supermarket administrators.

Thanks to the career that I choose and the opportunities in Megasuper(Retail company in Costa Rica, Productos Kity s.a(Snack company in Costa Rica) and El Exito Bentacur(Fashion company in Costa Rica) I could stablish methods to standardize the process to optimize the data cleaning and processing, also in Walmart(Intendecia dpto) and Amazon(GO AI dpto) I could contribute with improvement in the new processes, so I have been involved with this data analysis almost all my job career.

I really enjoy math and investigating why I have enjoyed all of my jobs and took all the best things from them; I also like working with method and logistic so I think data analysis is one of my passions.
